## Our factory produces a variety of different flavored snacks and we want to check the number of instances of a certain type. We have a conveyor belt full of different types of snacks represented by different numbers. Our function will accept a list of numbers (representing the type of snack), a number for the second parameter (the type of snack we are looking for), and another number as the third parameter (the maximum number of that type of snack on the conveyor belt). The function will return True if the snack we are searching for appears more times than we provided as our third parameter. 
#Write your function here
def more_than_n(my_list, item, n):
  eq = my_list.count(item)
  if eq > n:
    return True
  else:
    return False

#Uncomment the line below when your function is done
print(more_than_n([2, 4, 6, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2], 2, 3))
